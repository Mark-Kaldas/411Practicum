10/9/17 - 10/15/17

  Team:
    a. Created an organizational structure (will be organized into a report that's due 10/19)
    b. Set up a working environment - GitHub and Google Spreadsheets
    c. Decided on processors/accelerometer/transceiver/power delivery method
  
  Gomathy:
    a.
  
  Mark:
    a. Researched microcontrollers to use.
    b. Explored accelerometer options in terms of which is easiest to interface with chosen microcontrollers.
  
  Tapas:
    a. Explored methods of power delivery (zener voltage regulators/voltage divider/voltage regulator chip) and concluded that we will use buck converters because of their efficiency, and because they're cool
    b. Pushed team to decide on parts ADXL345 (accelerometer) and NRF24L01+ (transceivers) by determining which were optimal
    c. Assigned ARs to team for ownership of the blocks we are starting with.
    
  Yebin:
    a. Organized BOM and sort out which components to which vendors.
    b. Looked into chassis and motor driver ic.
